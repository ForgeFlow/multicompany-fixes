==========================
Multicompany Property Base
==========================

This module is part of a set of modules that are intended to make sure that
the property fields are consistent in a multi-company environment.

The module provides the foundation by which a user will be able to maintain
company dependent fields for multiple companies simultaneously
(no need to switch to another company) on a given model.

For example, a user can access to a partner or product and view/update
all company-specific fields, for all companies for which she has permissions.


Installation
============

To install this module, simply follow the standard install process.
